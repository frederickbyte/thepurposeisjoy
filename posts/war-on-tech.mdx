Why do political and cultural leaders hate technology? Some things I've noticed:

- Leaders and politicians hate technology
	- Conservatives are modern-day Luddites
	- Liberals oppose large, successful companies
	- Both want government control and regulation of internet/tech
- Many blame the internet and social media for today’s cultural problems
- They correctly identify the symptoms:
	- children and young adults are on mobile devices and social media, and
	- they are increasingly depressed and miserable (date is worse for girls)
- The solution, many argue, is more government, more regulation, more internet oversight
	- “National Security”, “protect children and/or democracy”
- People ignore free will, volition, and parenting; they act as if children are determined to believe what they see on their phones
- Kids are addicted to scrolling and watching content, and people think "Gov’t needs to control this!" (Age Gate-Keeping)

### What are the true causes?
- Cycle of: poor education (esp. gov’t schools)-> bad parenting -> depressed children
- Our culture tells young adults that the world is malevolent and hostile; that their minds are incapable of understanding true reality; life is a series of struggle and sadness with occasional relief
- Primary education: conceptual-level learning vs perceptual-level

### Ideas are the solution
- A proper philosophy (Objectivism) is the solution to our decaying culture
- Aristotle and Ayn Rand
- Government intervention will *worsen* things
